# Climate Data Analysis and Customer Sales Data Insights

## Overview

This repository contains two comprehensive data analysis projects:

1. **Climate Data Analysis**: Focuses on identifying trends, patterns, and anomalies in climate data to understand environmental changes over time.
2. **Customer Sales Data Insights**: Examines sales data to uncover customer behaviors, sales trends, and actionable insights for business growth.

## Project 1: Climate Data Analysis

### Objectives
- Analyze trends in climate variables like temperature and precipitation.
- Detect anomalies in weather patterns.
- Visualize seasonal and long-term climate variations.

### Features
- **Summary Statistics**: Calculate mean, median, and mode for climate variables.
- **Trend Analysis**: Create line charts to show changes in temperature and rainfall over time.
- **Heatmaps**: Visualize correlations between climatic factors such as temperature and humidity.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify extreme climatic events over decades.

### Tools and Technologies
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and cleaning.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For visualizing climate trends.
